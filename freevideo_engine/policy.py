# GPU bytes a request needs beyond resident block weights under the sub-10 GiB
# chunking profile: activations, the block-output cache, the transfer slot, root
# weights and allocator slack. From one complete 1344x768, 243-frame, 8-step run
# on a 12 GiB RTX 4080 Laptop at resident_blocks 9, where reserved VRAM peaked at
# 11.06 GiB; subtracting the nine resident blocks leaves 7.43 GiB. head_chunk 4
# then measured 0.73 GiB more than head_chunk 2 over three warm steps, and this
# keeps a small margin above the sum. window_batch stays at 1 in this band, so
# nothing is added for batched windows.
#
# Use the whole-run peak, not a slope. Reserved VRAM climbs 0.74 GiB per step
# for the first steps and then flattens, so extrapolating three probe steps
# predicted 11.82 GiB against the 11.06 GiB actually measured over eight.
# Compare against reserved rather than allocated: reserved is what occupies the
# device, and expandable segments are unavailable on Windows.
#
# Earlier interrupted runs reported a 5.15 GiB peak and are not evidence: the
# RAM guard stopped them inside the first sampling step, before the peak.
# Measured on Ada only; larger profiles keep their own estimates.
#
# Reference arithmetic for small-memory requests. Larger head groups are

# Head group and its activation allowance for the band under 10 GiB. Four
# heads cost exactly what two do. Measured on an H200 at three corners of the
# band with the card as the ceiling, changing nothing but the group:
#
#   8 GiB, 243 frames    45.41 -> 37.22 s/step   peak 7.34 GiB both
#   9 GiB, 345 frames    72.11 -> 58.26 s/step   peak 8.34 GiB both
#  10 GiB, 345 frames    56.11 -> 47.31 s/step   peak 9.39 GiB both
#
# Those corners span residual offload on and off, the host attention buffer on
# and off, and 0 to 2 resident blocks, and the peak did not move in any of
# them. The arithmetic bound agrees: a slice is tokens x heads x 128 x 2
# bytes, so doubling the group adds 151 MiB of QKV at 345 frames with all
# three tensors live, against 0.66 GiB of measured spare. That bound is what
# carries this to architectures with no measurement here -- every corner above
# is SM90. This needs no arithmetic of its own -- unlike eight heads, which
# cost 0.00, 0.41 and 0.84 GiB at the same three corners and overran a 10 GiB
# card at 345 frames. That interacts with where the attention outputs live and
# would need its own accounting and more corners than three.
# Eight heads in this band, where the budget covers them. Measured on an
# H200 at 1344x768x243 with the card as the ceiling, changing only the group:
#
#   9 GiB card, budget 8.50    13.03 -> 10.43 s/step   peak 8.34 -> 8.43
#  10 GiB card, budget 9.50    13.00 -> 10.37 s/step   peak 9.33 -> 9.33
#
# So 20% for 0.09 GiB at one corner and nothing at the other. Two corners
# refuse it, and 8.5 GiB is the reserve that reproduces all four: an 8 GiB
# card's 7.50 budget does not reach it, and the group peaked 8.02 there,
# over the card by 0.02 with every window and both chunk sizes. A 10 GiB
# card at 345 frames needs 10.42 after the token scaling below against a
# 9.50 budget, and the group peaked 10.30 there, over by 0.30.
#
# Where the outputs live interacts with this: a 9 GiB card at 345 frames
# stages residuals and outputs on the host, and eight heads did fit there
# at a 8.34 GiB peak. This reserve declines that corner, which costs the
# 15% it measured and keeps one rule for the band. The token axis is under
# measurement and is what would separate them.
#
# The entry is 8.2, not 8.5, because both peaks above were measured with the
# attention outputs on the GPU and GPU_ATTENTION_OUTPUT_BYTES adds that 0.3
# back after selection. Carrying 8.5 here charged it twice, which pushed a
# 9 GiB card's outputs to the host -- and eight heads with host outputs

## News

- **2026-10-06** · **[Gallery](https://freevideo-community.pages.dev/#gallery) is live.** Watch 20-second clips made with FreeVideo, and the four quality levels side by side.
- **2026-10-06** · **[v0.2.3](https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo/releases/tag/v0.2.3): videos carry their workflow.** Drop a FreeVideo video onto the ComfyUI canvas to restore its prompt, seed and settings. Earlier videos can get theirs too.
- **2026-10-05** · **[v0.2.0](https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo/releases/tag/v0.2.0): four quality levels.** Choose Light, Medium, High or Max for each video; higher levels give higher quality but take longer. Results can be exported as sharing images or videos with the generation time and GPU.
- **2026-10-05** · **[v0.1.2](https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo/releases/tag/v0.1.2): FreeVideo on Mac.** Apple silicon Macs generate MiniMax H3 videos locally (preview).
- **2026-10-03** · **Community LoRAs.** Use MiniMax H3 LoRAs right in your workflow. See [examples](docs/LoRA.md).
- **2026-10-02** · **FreeVideo is open source.** MiniMax H3 on consumer GPUs with as little as 8 GB of VRAM.

## About

FreeVideo is a local inference engine for MiniMax H3 on consumer GPUs, built on [OpenVDN](https://github.com/OpenVDN)'s 8-step [VDN-H3](https://huggingface.co/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3) model with [Video DeltaNet](https://openvdn.github.io/)'s hybrid attention.

It coordinates VRAM, system memory and disk, adapting weight placement, compute precision and attention kernels to the available hardware. FreeVideo runs as a ComfyUI plugin, with a Windows launcher for setup and command-line support on Linux. Its core features include:

- **Hardware-adaptive execution**: Chooses the FP8 compute path for each GPU architecture, either native FP8 or FP8 storage with BF16 compute, and automatically probes the available attention kernels.
- **Low-memory inference**: Weight streaming, asynchronous prefetching and chunked computation keep peak memory low, enabling inference with as little as 8 GB of VRAM and 16 GB of RAM.
- **Multimodal inputs**: Text prompts, first and last frames, and image, video and audio references.
- **Community LoRAs**: Use MiniMax H3 LoRAs in your workflow. See [examples](docs/LoRA.md).
- **ComfyUI integration**: A dedicated creative workspace inside ComfyUI that supports two-pass sampling and batch generation and keeps a history of past creations. For finer control, switch to the node view to add LoRAs or customize the workflow.
- **One-click deployment**: The Windows and Mac launchers set up ComfyUI, the runtime environment and the models, reuse existing models, and support offline installation.

## Getting Started

### Windows

1. [Download FreeVideo.exe](https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo/releases/latest/download/FreeVideo.exe) and run it.
2. Select an existing ComfyUI folder or install a new one. Existing model folders can be added for reuse; missing models are downloaded automatically.
3. Click **Install & launch**. ComfyUI opens in the browser with the FreeVideo workspace.

  <img alt="FreeVideo creative workspace" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7647a6f8-4306-403c-b147-45d7a393e18d" width="92%">
</div>

**Offline installation:** Download the packages from [Quark](https://pan.quark.cn/s/c51235b84618) and drag the ZIP files into the launcher without extracting them. The common models and the model pack for your GPU (30/40 series or 50 series) are required; a new ComfyUI installation also requires the environment package.

### macOS (Apple silicon preview)

1. [Download FreeVideo-Mac-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo/releases/latest/download/FreeVideo-Mac-arm64.dmg), open it and drag **FreeVideo.app** into **Applications**.
2. Open FreeVideo, then select an existing ComfyUI folder or install a new one. Existing model folders can be added for reuse; the runtime environment and missing models are downloaded automatically.
3. Click **Install & launch**. ComfyUI opens in the browser with the FreeVideo workspace.

This preview has been tested on an M5 Mac with 24 GB of unified memory. See the [Mac&nbsp;guide](docs/Mac.md) for generation times and memory.

The Mac preview isn't notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks it the first time you open it. Download it only from the Releases page, then check the file and approve it as described in the [Mac guide](docs/Mac.md#first-open). This approves FreeVideo only; your other security settings stay as they are.

### Existing ComfyUI

Install FreeVideo as a custom node:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo.git
```

Restart ComfyUI, open **Workflow → Browse Templates → FreeVideo → FreeVideo-All-in-One**, and complete the setup in FreeVideo **Settings**.

### Linux

Install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeVideo.git && cd FreeVideo
./setup.sh
```

Generate a video from a prompt file:

```bash
./freevideo generate --prompt-file prompt.txt --out video.mp4
```
